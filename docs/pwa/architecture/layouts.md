## Default
hubble provides a default layout which is called default.vue (this layout is loaded by Nuxt automatically, if
you don't set a layout for a page manually).

## Checkout
The checkout layout is a lighter, distraction free version of the default layout.

## Error
Overrides the default [Nuxt.js error page](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/layouts/#error-page)
even though it's a layout.
